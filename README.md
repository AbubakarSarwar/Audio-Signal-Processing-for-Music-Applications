# Music Signal Processing

## Introduction 

Music signal processing or music processing is the intentional alteration of music audio signals often through an audio effect or effects unit. As music audio signals may be electronically represented in either digital or analog format, signal processing may occur in either domain.

## What are we planning to do here?

- Classfication based on genre
- Similar Song Recommendation
- Instrument Detection
- Emotion Recoginition

More activities can include:

- Mashup Fingerprinting
- Cover Detection
- Singer Identification
- and much more..

## Application Field

The application build here will comprise of the following fields

- Machine Learning
- Music Information Retrieval
- Audio Signal Processing for Music Application
- Nueral Networks
- Deep Learning

## What Does this repository include

Will be updated as repository gets commited as time progresses.

```
- repo
  - Features
  - README.md 
```

## External Libraries?

We plan to fulfill our music signal processing using the **Librosa** and **Essentia** Library

Librosa Documentation: http://librosa.github.io/librosa/

Other Python libraries include:

- Numpy
- Scipy
- Ipython
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib

For Ubuntu Users: ```pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib ipython scikit-learn```
